Relieving Stress Through Yoga at CUNY
Relieving Stress Through Yoga at CUNY

Are you feeling burnt out? Is the weight on your shoulders too overbearing? Yoga may be the right option for you.
There are many ways to uplift your mood and make your body feel lighter, but yoga is one the easiest ways. You don’t have to be an expert in yoga to benefit from its rewards. It can help you feel better physically and emotionally and is not as involved as other exercising regimes. Although some poses may be very difficult, there are still numerous sets of poses that are easy to do and promote relaxation.
Yoga’s methodology traditionally involves a specific set of poses, meditation and deep breathing; it is a more spiritual approach to healing. The various poses in yoga, like the child’s pose, fish pose, downward dog and upward dog, help alleviate tension in the body. You can even create variations of these poses.
For CUNY students, there are a few clubs and programs that focus on mental health awareness that may involve meditation or yoga. Examples of this include the
WISE
(Women Inspiring Strength and Empowerment) club at Queens College and the
Active Minds
Club at the College of Staten Island. The WISE club is a social club that empowers women physically, emotionally and spiritually through self-care, yoga and venting.
Other colleges have held wellness events in the past that feature yoga, especially during finals week. For example,
City College
offered free yoga classes last semester for students through its Health and Wellness Services. The CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health and Policy held
Yoga For Clarity
, a one-hour yoga session focused on relaxation last year providing students with a safe place to unwind.
York College
had a yoga event as well last semester, Yoga and Movement with Eo Constantatos, welcoming students with all levels of yoga experience to participate and practice various approaches to strengthen body awareness. The
Graduate Center
also provides students with resources to promote fitness and yoga, as well as discounts at various fitness centers for students. Make sure to keep an eye out for events like these on your campus or other colleges.
Outside of CUNY, there are also other resources for attending free yoga sessions in the city, including non-profit organizations like
Integral Yoga Institute NYC
and
Urban Connect
.
